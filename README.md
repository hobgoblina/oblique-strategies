# Oblique Strategies
A digital rendering of Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt - ***Over one hundred worthwhile dilemmas*** - a set of insights, produced as a deck of cards, which can be used to overcome creative blocks and reorient your perspective.

An explanation of the project that's included with some editions states:
> These cards evolved from our separate observations of the principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated.
>
> They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.

Available for web and mobile (Android only, atm)

## Developing / Building
Made with flutter, no flavors, nothing special.

Build with `flutter build`, etc.

There's Gitpod configs for easy/ephemeral dev environments.

## Contributing
A couple things I'd be interested in doing with this are:
- Translations
- Other decks and editions
  - [Grotesque Tables II](https://www.grotesquetablesii.com/)
  - the 1996 Oblique Strategies edition illustrated by Pae White (lmk if you have access to a deck or high-res scans!!!)
  - maybe decks intended for other practices (strategies for programming, etc)
 
I haven't implemented a framework for either of those yet, but I'll get them going either when I get around to it or when I get prompted by *you* to do so. 

Plz open an issue if you'd like to contribute translations, requests for (or access to) other decks, bug reports, or something else entirely.
