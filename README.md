# Oblique Strategies
A digital rendering of Oblique Strategies by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt - ***Over one hundred worthwhile dilemmas*** - a set of insights, produced as a deck of cards, which can be used to overcome creative blocks and reorient your perspective.

An explanation of the project that's included with some editions states:
> These cards evolved from our separate observations of the principles underlying what we were doing. Sometimes they were recognized in retrospect (intellect catching up with intuition), sometimes they were identified as they were happening, sometimes they were formulated.
>
> They can be used as a pack (a set of possibilities being continuously reviewed in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the shuffled pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation. In this case the card is trusted even if its appropriateness is quite unclear. They are not final, as new ideas will present themselves, and others will become self-evident.

Available for web and mobile (Android only, currently)

## Translations
#### Crowdin
The easiest way to contribute translations is [on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/oblique-strategies).

If you'd like to provide translations for a language that isn't in the list of target languages, please create a Github issue to let me know. My Crowdin account is limited by the free plan, so I can only add so many languages to the list, but I'll happily make room for your language.

I'll try to keep on top of publishing new app versions as translations get completed in Crowdin, but it'd be helpful if you create a Github issue to let me know.

#### Manual
Alternatively, you can manually write a new `.yaml` translation file in the `assets/l10n` directory, translate the strings in the `en.yaml` file, and open a pull request.

## Developing / Building
Made with flutter, no flavors, nothing special.

Build with `flutter build`, etc.

There's Gitpod configs for easy/ephemeral dev environments.
